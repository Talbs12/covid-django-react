Privius knowledge  - 
my privius knowledge include frontend and backend coming from a web programming course I did in my third year of the degree,
with slightly different technologies like node.js,java,javascript,html,css, etc..
Resources that i used for learninig - 
In this project requires me to expand my technological knowledge while relying on existing knowledge.
I had to deal with technologies that were new to me like 
* postgresql - for handling data base
* react  - frontend
* django and phyton - backend 
I learned how to use these technologies by sites offered to me in a Google search for key queries for every technology that was new to me
from syntax to whole snippets of code that perform actions I needed to make the project work.
the sites that i used to implement the projacts - 
* stack overflow  
* bootstrap
* seraching for "react metrial ui" in google for packages and code that i was nedded to import.
* rest api sites
* jetbrains
* youtube
